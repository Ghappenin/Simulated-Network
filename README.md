<h1>Simulated Network With Cisco Packet Trackers </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
By the end of this project, you will create a small simulated network from scratch using Cisco Packet Tracer. You will be able to identify the basic fundamentals of computer networking and the very basic architecture behind the network devices (Routers and Switches). Moreover, you will learn and practice how to get all these devices and components connected together.  Finally, you will be able to troubleshoot the issues and write some basic commands to get the network fully functioning.

<br />
<br />
Add IP address of your choosing, click in "Subnet Mask" and this will auto generate for you -> repeat for 'PC 2' with different IP address <br/>

<br />
<br />
Check PCs can talk to eachother: right click 'PC 1' -> Desktop -> Command Prompt -> Ping 'PC 2' IP address  <br/>

<br />
Lets connect to the internet.. Build a seperate network -> connect to 1 router -> router 2 to your network. Red flags = Routers need config. <br/>

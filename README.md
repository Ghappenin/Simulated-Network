<h1>Simulated Network With Cisco Packet Trackers </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
By the end of this project, you will create a small simulated network from scratch using Cisco Packet Tracer. You will be able to identify the basic fundamentals of computer networking and the very basic architecture behind the network devices (Routers and Switches). Moreover, you will learn and practice how to get all these devices and components connected together.  Finally, you will be able to troubleshoot the issues and write some basic commands to get the network fully functioning.

<br />
<br />
Navigate to "End Devices" click on 'PC' and add 2 to your network:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
"Connection Types" -> "Automatically Choose Connection Type":  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9GAVVK4.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Connect your 'Switch' with your 'PC' -> wait for connection to show green on both <br/>

<br />
<br />
Click on 'PC 1" -> "Desktop" and select "IP Configuration" <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L2hc4Lk.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Add IP address of your choosing, click in "Subnet Mask" and this will auto generate for you -> repeat for 'PC 2' with different IP address <br/>

<br />
<br />
Check PCs can talk to eachother, click 'PC 1' -> Desktop -> Command Prompt -> Ping 'PC 2' IP address  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5MsfAYZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Expand the network by adding another switch, 2 PCs (give IP address and Subnet Mask) and connecting them <br/>

<br />
<br />
Lets connect to the internet.. Build a seperate network -> connect to 1 router -> router 2 to your network. Red flags = Routers need config. <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CN2h9WJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Click Router 1 -> CLI -> NO -> Copy prompts shown below.. once completed you will see a connection between router 1 and our network <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FnDAmhp.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Click Router 0 -> CLI -> NO -> Copy prompts shown below.. you will show green flags for all connections <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mX9HLfW.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Give each network an 'address table' and label them on your screen with the "note" tool <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tjUSdVa.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Click Router 0 and configure as shown <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMTgWC1.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Click Router 1 and configure as shown... lastly config. ip address on both added PCs <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now lets get the routers to speak to eachother -> Click router 0 -> CLI -> configure as shown <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jwgyqx3.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Click on router 1 -> CLI -> configure as shown <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IjB2JTR.png" height="80%" width="80%" />
<br />
<br />
Now we must configure the "Default Gateway" of each PC on each netowrk to match the interface of that network -> complete on all PCs <br/>
